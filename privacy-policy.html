                <p class="mb-4">Our servers automatically recognize visitors' domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). The OvO2 Unblocked Site may gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but that data may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the OvO2 Unblocked Site), our web servers automatically collect usage information. Such usage information includes information about how our visitors use and navigate the OvO2 Unblocked Site. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length of their stays, browser type, and referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Site.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Traffic information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis. More information about sharing information will follow in part 7.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">In addition, Advertisers on the OvO2 Unblocked General Site might receive information gathered by cookies for targeted advertising purposes. Further information regarding the use of cookies can be found below.</p>
                
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 bg-green-700 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded-lg">3. Data Retention</h2>
                
                <p class="mb-4">OvO2 Unblocked may retain users' data for the following purposes:</p>
                
                <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
                    <li class="mb-2">To develop new features and improve the OvO2 Unblocked Site;</li>

The relevant provider of such a third party game is responsible for ensuring that any processing of personal data by them in the context of a game complies with applicable data protection laws.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">Generally, OvO2 Unblocked does not permit third party content providers to collect personal data about Users. However, if any personal data will be collected by a third party content provider, OvO2 Unblocked will contractually require that the processing of personal data by them in the context of a game complies with applicable data protection laws.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">OvO2 Unblocked may work with third parties that are based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), and may transfer data about you to the countries in which these parties reside. Whenever we share personal data originating in the EU with an entity outside of the EEA, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses, with your consent, or because such transfer is necessary performance of a contract.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">If you have any questions about our policy regarding international data transfers, please contact us at chaskx@gmail.com</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 bg-green-700 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded-lg">9. Children Users</h2>

                <p class="mb-4">We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly. This is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the OvO2 Unblocked Kids Site, or through an age-gate in certain games on the OvO2 Unblocked General Site: in order to comply with the legislation, you could be presented to an age screen when starting the game. When presented with this age screen, it is important that you state the correct age. Based on your age information and your device settings, OvO2 Unblocked does not process personal data of children under the minimum age limit (Children Users) that is prescribed by the legislation in the individual jurisdictions for behavioral advertisement.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the OvO2 Unblocked General Site, and the OvO2 Unblocked Kids Site supports and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). The Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the OvO2 Unblocked General Site and the OvO2 Unblocked Kids site will not request any personal information from Children Users. There is no registration required for the OvO2 Unblocked Kids Site and any advertising shown on the OvO2 Unblocked Kids Site, or in the the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the OvO2 Unblocked General Site, is age-appropriate. The OvO2 Unblocked Kids Site and the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the OvO2 Unblocked General Site will not show behaviorally targeted ads or allow third parties to track the activity of Children Users for that purpose.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The OvO2 Unblocked Kids Site and the the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the OvO2 Unblocked General Site may collect and use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, including cookies, from Children Users, but only for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to help us:</p>

                </ul>

                <p class="mb-4">We have separated our platform into a few sections. OvO2 Unblocked Kids was created for our youngest audience and is fully COPPA compliant. If you are a Child User, you should only use the OvO2 Unblocked Kids Site and only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian. On OvO2 Unblocked.com, you'll find games that are intended at users that are over 13. OvO2 Unblocked.com is not targeted towards children under the age of 13 and it will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" >To learn more about COPPA, please reference this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program: <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html" class="text-green-700 hover:text-green-800 break-words">https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html</a>.</p>

                <p class="mb-4" >If you are an individual in the European Union (EU), we collect and process data about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. This means we collect and process your data only when:</p>

                <p class="mb-4">OvO2 Unblocked makes certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal data. Please review the below information outlining your choices and how to exercise them. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe. If our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you updated. We may request more information to confirm your identity before acting on any request.</p>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="font-bold">Delete your data: </p>
                    <p>You also hold the right to have your personal data deleted. This is sometimes known as the 'right to be forgotten'. To request that we delete all personal data about you, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4">After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim.</p>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="font-bold">Restrict Processing: </p>
                    <p>You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances. This is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data. Rather than requesting we delete all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="font-bold">Data Portability: </p>
                    <p>You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a structured, commonly used format that you can move your data between our service and the services of others. We may request more information to confirm your identity before providing any personal data.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="font-bold">Right to Object: </p>
                    <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request. Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation. Even after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.
